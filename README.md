# order-processing-pipeline-
## Overview
This project implements an order processing pipeline utilizing concurrent workers (Goroutines in Go) to handle various stages of order fulfillment.

## Workflow
The order processing pipeline consists of several stages:

1. *Receiving Orders*: Incoming orders are received from different endpoints, such as an e-commerce site. This initial stage captures and queues the orders for further processing.

2. *Order Validation*: Orders are validated to ensure their correctness and accuracy. This stage checks for any errors or discrepancies in the received orders.

3. *Inventory Reservation*: Once orders are validated, inventory reservation occurs. This step allocates and reserves the necessary inventory items for fulfilling the orders.

4. *Order Fulfillment*: The final stage involves fulfilling the orders and dispatching them to the customers who placed them. This phase completes the order processing cycle.

## Implementation Details
- *Concurrency*: The pipeline employs concurrent workers (Goroutines) for each stage, allowing independent processing of orders simultaneously.
- *Inter-stage Communication*: Each stage communicates with the subsequent stage, passing on processed and validated data for further handling.
- *Error Handling*: The system includes mechanisms to handle errors at each stage to maintain the integrity of the order processing flow.
